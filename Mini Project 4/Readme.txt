The main driving code is MP4.m. It runs the code in order to provide the solutions for the parts of the assignment. The forward kinematics code developed for this is fwdkiniter.m, and the inverse kinematics is invkin_iterJ. There are no required inputs for this code. It runs entirely self contained, just all of the dependency files, such as the functions and .mat files for the S must be in the directory. There is not much one would want to change in this code based off of the assignment, but if one would want to change the inverse kinematics parameters like alpha and N, they would do so manunally in the proj4kincheck.m file. And if they wanted to change which SO(3) was used they would do so manually in the invkin_iterJ.m file.
